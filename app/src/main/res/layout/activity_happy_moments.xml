It’s because the happiness in a marriage is simply a product of your individual happiness levels and the extent of togetherness.



You marry someone because you love the person, and obviously you want to be a happily married couple.

However, even if you’re happy you cannot make your partner truly happy if that happiness doesn’t come from within him or her.

You can share your happiness with your partner, but you can’t impose that happiness, nor try to direct his or her happiness.

Since marriage implies a union, there has to be togetherness among the spouses. If the couple lacks togetherness, they would not be happy.

Therefore, you can only find happiness in a marriage if you and your partner are really happy from within and enjoy acts of togetherness."/>

Here are some ways of being together and enjoying each other in a happy married life:

Smile and look lovingly at each other while your partner works, cooks, or walks in after a long day.
Find time to hold hands or cuddle in bed. Just become best friendswith one another.
Discover the first grey hair and celebrate that moment.
Look at old photographs and movies together.
Read the newspaper, or go for long walks together. Get up and sip your morning cup of tea or coffee together.
Eat meals or watch a TV channel that your spouse likes, even if you don’t.
Just be together and let your eye’s do the talking, without any words spoken.
This list can be endless, and you can keep adding to it in the comments below!

As you see, happiness lies in those precious moments of togetherness that you share without any expectations.

The best way to find happiness in a marriage is basically when you remain w

ho you are. And you remain willingly available to the other person, without letting the ego become an obstacle.

You love and live with your partner because you love them and are willing to do anything for them.

You have a choice to find happiness by paying attention to the things that really matter, and ignore or let go of the things that don’t.

Life is full of twists and turns. But if you’re together in a marriage and search for companionship in one another, then you can make your life’s journey worthwhile.

So the search for happiness in a marriage isn’t tough, provided you are willing to work for it. " />
