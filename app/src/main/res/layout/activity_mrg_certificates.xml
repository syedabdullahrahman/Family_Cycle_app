A divorce decree is a court document that is a final judgment from divorce court. It contains information about your case, including spousal support, child support, custody, visitation, property division, and other information.Only a court can issue a divorce decree. You receive it at the end of your case.
A divorce certificate is a completely different document from a divorce decree. A certificate is not prepared by a court. Instead, your state's health department or bureau of vital statistics issues the certificate. This is usually the same place where you get your birth certificate.
Unlike a lengthy divorce decree, a divorce certificate is a simple document that shows:

  1.You are divorced
  2.The names of both former spouses
  3.The date of the divorce
  4.The place of the divorce.
  5.Uses of a Divorce Certificate

A divorce certificate is used for limited purposes, and not all states issue a divorce certificate. You can use it for:

  1.Getting a name change
  2.Showing proof of divorce without revealing the details of your divorce
  4.Getting a travel visa
  5.Getting a passport, unless your name change is not on the certificate
  6.Inheritance purposes, to show you are single,Getting married
  8.Anywhere you need to show proof of divorce.
